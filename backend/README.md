# Passport Details Extractor - Backend

## Overview
The backend of the **Passport Details Extractor** is designed to provide a robust and scalable server-side application using **Node.js** and **Express.js**. The primary objective is to handle file uploads, integrate with an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) API, and serve extracted data to the frontend in a secure and efficient manner.

## Key Theoretical Concepts

### RESTful API Design
- **REST (Representational State Transfer)**: A software architectural style that defines a set of constraints for creating web services. The backend adheres to REST principles by using standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to perform operations on resources.
- **Statelessness**: Each API request from the client contains all the information needed to process the request. The server does not store any client context between requests, enhancing scalability and reliability.

### Middleware Architecture
- **Middleware Functions**: Functions that have access to the request object (`req`), response object (`res`), and the next middleware function in the applicationâ€™s request-response cycle. Middleware is used for tasks such as logging, authentication, parsing request bodies, and handling CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing).

### File Handling
- **File Uploads**: The backend employs middleware to handle multipart/form-data submissions, which is essential for processing file uploads. This involves managing file storage, naming conventions, and cleanup after processing.
- **Security Considerations**: It is crucial to validate file types and sizes to prevent potential security vulnerabilities such as file injection attacks.

### Optical Character Recognition (OCR)
- **OCR Technology**: A technology that enables the extraction of text from images. The backend integrates with an external OCR API to process uploaded passport images and retrieve textual data.
- **Data Parsing**: After receiving OCR results, the backend must parse the extracted text to identify relevant information such as names, document numbers, and expiry dates using regular expressions or other parsing techniques.

### Error Handling
- **Robust Error Management**: Implementing comprehensive error handling strategies is vital for maintaining application stability. This includes defining clear error messages and appropriate HTTP status codes for different failure scenarios (e.g., 400 for client errors, 500 for server errors).
- **User Feedback**: Providing meaningful error messages helps users understand what went wrong and how they can rectify issues.

### Security Practices
- **CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)**: A security feature that allows or restricts resources on a web server based on the origin of the request. Proper CORS configuration is essential when serving APIs that will be accessed by web applications hosted on different domains.
- **Environment Variables**: Sensitive information such as API keys should be stored in environment variables rather than hard-coded in the application code. This practice enhances security by preventing exposure of credentials in version control systems.

## Conclusion
The backend of the Passport Details Extractor leverages modern web development principles and best practices to create a secure, efficient, and user-friendly application. By adhering to RESTful design principles and employing robust middleware architecture, this project exemplifies a well-structured approach to building scalable server-side applications.
