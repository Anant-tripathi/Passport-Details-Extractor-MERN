# Passport Details Extractor - Frontend

## Overview
The **Passport Details Extractor** frontend is built using **React**, providing a dynamic and responsive user interface for uploading passport images and displaying extracted information. This application leverages modern web technologies to create an intuitive user experience, demonstrating my skills in frontend development and state management.

## Key Features
- **File Upload Interface**: Users can easily upload passport images in JPG format using a simple file input.
- **Real-time Preview**: Once a file is uploaded, a preview of the image is displayed, enhancing user engagement and feedback.
- **Data Extraction Display**: After processing the document, the extracted details such as the passport holder's name, document number, and expiry date are shown clearly on the screen.
- **Loading State Management**: A loading indicator informs users that their document is being processed, improving the overall user experience.
- **Error Handling**: The application includes robust error handling to provide feedback in case of issues during file upload or processing.

## Technologies Used
- **React**: For building the user interface with component-based architecture.
- **Axios**: For making HTTP requests to the backend API to process uploaded documents.
- **CSS**: For styling the application and ensuring a responsive design across devices.

## Functionality
1. **File Selection**: Users can select a passport image from their device.
2. **Image Preview**: Upon selection, the image is displayed for user confirmation.
3. **Data Extraction Request**: When the user clicks the "Extract" button, an API request is sent to the backend for processing.
4. **Display Results**: The extracted information is displayed on the screen once received from the backend.
5. **Error Messages**: If any errors occur during uploading or processing, appropriate error messages are shown to guide users.

## Skills Demonstrated
- **Frontend Development**: Proficient use of React for building interactive UIs, showcasing my ability to create modular components and manage state effectively.
- **API Integration**: Experience in integrating RESTful APIs using Axios, demonstrating my understanding of asynchronous programming and data handling in JavaScript.
- **Responsive Design Principles**: Implementation of responsive design techniques using CSS to ensure usability across various devices and screen sizes.
- **Error Handling Strategies**: Ability to implement effective error handling mechanisms to enhance user experience and application reliability.

## Future Improvements
- Implement additional input validation to ensure only valid image files are uploaded.
- Enhance accessibility features to make the application usable for people with disabilities.
- Introduce unit tests for critical components to ensure robustness and reliability.
