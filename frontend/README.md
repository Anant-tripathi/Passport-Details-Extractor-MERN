# Passport Details Extractor

## Overview
The **Passport Details Extractor** is a full-stack web application built using the **MERN** (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack. This application allows users to upload passport images and utilizes an **OCR (Optical Character Recognition)** API to extract essential information such as the passport holder's name, document number, and expiry date. The project showcases my skills in full-stack development and my ability to integrate various technologies into a cohesive application.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: React
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express
- **Database**: MongoDB (for potential future enhancements)
- **File Upload Handling**: Multer
- **API Integration**: Axios for HTTP requests
- **OCR Service**: Custom OCR API for processing images
- **Environment Variables**: dotenv for managing sensitive information

## Features
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built with React to provide a seamless user experience.
- **File Upload Functionality**: Users can easily upload passport images.
- **Data Extraction**: Automatically extracts and displays the passport holder's name, document number, and expiry date.
- **Error Handling**: Displays appropriate error messages for file upload issues or processing errors.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.

## Usage Instructions
1. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser.
2. Use the file input to upload a passport image (JPG format).
3. Click on the "Extract" button to process the document.
4. View the extracted details displayed on the screen.

## Future Enhancements
- Implement user authentication to allow users to save their uploaded documents and extracted data.
- Enhance OCR capabilities by integrating additional OCR services for improved accuracy.
- Expand database functionality with MongoDB for storing user data and uploaded documents.
